The math department is perfect as it is, and there is nothing I would do to fix it. Keep doing what you're doing, Rowan.

April Fools, of course.

Through the years, I have accrued a few bones to pick with the Mathematics department. The largest of these problems is that, after having completed a Bachelor's degree in the subject, I don't feel comfortable claiming that I know very much more math than a bright high school student. Some of the blame for this may be attributed to myself; I did not spend much of my free time studying additional concepts in math but instead focused on Computer Science, and during most semesters I gave a higher priority to other courses than those in the Math degree. Regardless of this lack of focus on the subject, I somehow managed to walk out of this program with a 3.9 GPA in my math classes. I mention this not to brag, but instead to point out a serious issue. How can a student coast through an entire mathematics degree with flying colors while claiming that they aren't very far in mathematical understanding than a high school student? There must be something wrong with the degree in mathematics at Rowan that has limited my education. This is a complex and multifaceted issue, and I know not of math degrees in other schools so it may be far more widespread than simply at Rowan University. That said, I speculate that one of the largest problems is that **professors seem to be under a large amount of pressure to make their classes _easier_ each year, often at the expense of large chunks of the curriculum**.

I have thought long and hard about the possibility of incentivizing learning instead of giving good grades, but each idea that I've had has been quickly shut down by a counterexample. Here are a few:

> What if we enforced stricter standards for the specific topics that professors had to cover during each major course in the degree?

First of all, strict standards are one of the easiest ways to suck the life out of professors and discourage them from teaching students passionately. In addition, the computer science department has fairly strict standards that they must follow and most of the time when the subject becomes "too difficult", the professor brushes past it very quickly and gives their students a way to solve problems in that area by copying example solutions. Standards are not the problem, because no matter how strict they are it is possible to give padding to the material to make it digestable by a fifth grader.

> Maybe we can hire professors who we are confident are more passionate about ensuring that their students learn.

I refuse to claim that professors are not passionate about teaching their students. Most of them are brilliant people and they love the subject they are teaching, but it seems as though they're subject to an invisible force that prevents them from going too far into the math that they love. Many times, I've watched math professors at Rowan get excited about a specific topic and start to excitedly approach it in a lecture before "catching themselves" and getting back to what they're _supposed_ to be teaching.

> Perhaps the students are the problem. Do Rowan's undergraduate students truly care about learning math, or are they simply trying to get a degree and get out using the path of least resistance?

In my opinion, this is the true problem that I am left with. It only takes one glance at **[ratemyprofessors.com](https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/)** to understand that a majority of the students in this school are not getting the degree because they are excited about the subject. Almost without fail, every time I walk out of a course in Computer Science or Math feeling as though I have learned a lot, I find that the professor has one or two stars on this website and a bunch of comments that say "too hard". On the other hand, every 5-star professor that I naively selected because of their rating taught a course that was painstakingly slow and gave almost every student an A. 

Therefore, my only conclusion is that the Math department at Rowan is broken, but the professors are surely not at fault and it may even be difficult to blame the administration. Until this school figures out a way to modify its culture so that its students are excited about learning instead of annoyed by it, I don't see this problem coming to resolution. This could be a problem for the Math department, but I believe that it is actually an issue for _all_ departments at Rowan. I do not know how to solve this problem, but my hope is that as the school becomes more prestigious, its student body grows with it.
