title: "Mathematics Fields Metal - Terence Tao"

Before his age was two digits long, Terence Tao had an understanding of calculus comparable to that of a university student studying mathematics. He was given the resources to attend university at an early age, and completed his Ph. D. by the time he was twenty. With this in mind, it is fairly clear why Tao is an expert in a startling breadth of topics in math. However, the sheer amount of math that he has been able to explore and expand upon has put him into a position where he has been well deserving of the large number of awards that he has been given. Tao was awarded the Mathematics fields medal in 2006 for

> "his contributions to partial differential equations, combinatorics, harmonic analysis and additive number theory,"

in which some of his developments are explainable and understandable to laypeople and lowly college mathematics students. It seems as though the crowd favorite of these contributions is a proof that he made about prime numbers with Ben Green. In this beautifully crafted paper, the two mathematicians were able to show that the set of prime numbers contains arithmetic progressions of _any_ length. This is an incredible result, as any structure that mathematicians can find in prime numbers eventually ends up being used in dozens of seemingly disconnected applications. Tao's second contribution that was celebrated in his fields medal award was the progress that he made on the Kakeya Conjecture, a conjecture in the field of harmonic analysis involving needles and rotations that is not easily understood by an undergraduate mathematics student.

Something I find inspirational about Terence Tao is his practical approach to mathematics. He has spoken of the notion that many people have, which supposes that most advances in mathematics happen after Eureka moments in which inspiration strikes and all of the pieces of a problem come togeher. For Tao, this is an absurd idea. He solves problems in tiny chunks, by chipping away at them slowly with manageable sub-problems until it is possible to understand the problem as a whole. The way that he describes this process makes it seem much more acheivable to everyday people, and in my personal opinion it draws a little bit of humanity into his seemingly endless understanding of the subject of mathematics.
